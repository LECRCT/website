# Research

The batteries used in cellphones and electric cars are comprised of three parts: two metal electrodes and a liquid electrolyte in between. This liquid electrolyte – a liquid solvent into which we add a conductive salt – takes up the distance of a diameter of human hair. This is small, but, it is a critical component that is both the reason the batteries last long (sometimes 10 000 charge discharges!) but also why they will die. One question we have is, can we have a liquid electrolyte that works in Canadian winter temperatures without freezing. Can we engineer that? The answer I propose is yes. How would we do this? This is a question we ask in our research (here in simple terms). We take this liquid electrolyte, and zoom in ten thousand (10 000) times (!) and see all the movement of the molecules and salt ions, and sometimes they move alone, and sometimes they clump up and move together. This is why the words “supramolecular” and “supraionic” are sometimes used - they can refer to these clumps of salt ions and molecules which move together. Now how do we “zoom in” on a liquid to “see” what is happening? 

Here we use a series of state of the art computer­-based methods which rely on advanced physical theories (the technical names are thermodynamics, statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics). We suggest to 1) establish a proper description and 2) connect this zoomed­-in (technical term is “nano”) description to “zoomed­-out” properties. One of these is the freezing temperature of the liquid electrolyte, which we can show can change directly as a consequence of everything happening in the zoomed­-in picture (nano). Now we can gave one example of why this is important – making batteries such that the liquid electrolyte does not freeze below 30 degrees Celsius in Canadian winters. The ambition of our research is not limited to this property only – similar scientific approaches can be applied to hydrometallurgy and related processes, where battery electrodes are recycled via vats of liquid electrolytes that extract the valuable elements that we can then separate out. In addition, the ambition of such work has relevance to the fundamental field of physical chemistry, where finding the most accurate description of liquid electrolytes is a goal in itself.
