# Research

We are currently interested in the physical chemistry and electrochemistry of liquid electrolytes used in electrochemical devices and hydrometallurgical applications. These can range from non-aqueous solvents (such as carbonates and ethers) to aqueous electrolytes with conventional salts or acids. We are also interested more generally in questions pertaining to phase equilibria.

Subjects of interest include tying the freezing point of liquid electrolytes as a function of composition and temperature, as well as the solubilty limits, to the nanoscale and to molecular and ionic interactions.
