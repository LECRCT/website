# Research

We are currently interested in the physical chemistry and electrochemistry of liquid electrolytes used in electrochemical devices and hydrometallurgical applications. These can range from non-aqueous solvents (such as carbonates and ethers) to aqueous electrolytes with conventional salts or acids. 

Subjects of interest include tying the freezing point of liquid electrolytes as a function of composition and temperature, as well as the solubilty limits, to nanoscopic thermodynamics and molecular and ionic interactions.
