# Research

We are currently interesting in researching the physical chemistry and electrochemistry of phase diagrams for liquid electrolytes used in electrochemical devices and hydrometallurgical applications.

Subjects of interest are the freezing point of liquid electrolytes as a function of composition and temperature, as well as the solubilty limits.
