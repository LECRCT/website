### About the research group 

Our research group is part of the Centre for Research in Computational Thermochemistry at the Polytechnique Montr√©al.

The images above show:
 
(1) Probing the freezing temperature of lithium-ion battery ternary electrolytes through differential scanning calorimetry. See ["Relating the salt thermodynamic factor to solvent activities in ternary multi-solvent electrolytes."](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1945-7111/ada646/meta). Top left schematic adapted from the Handbook of Batteries.
 
(2) Solvent transfer energies of lithium chloride in water-ethanol mixtures.
