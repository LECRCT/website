### About the Lab

Our research group is part of the Centre for Research in Computational Thermochemistry at the Polytechnique Montr√©al.

The images above show:
 
(1) Different quantities of interest for li-ion and multivalent batteries, which are relevant at different time and lengths scales.
 
(2) The flowsheet for a hydrometallurgical process where the thermodynamic driving forces for dissolution, and the solubility limits for a ternary electrolyte system are illustrated.
